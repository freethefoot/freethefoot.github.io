Please contact me via <a href="mailto:freethefoot.hamilton@gmail.com">email</a> if you have a collaboration in mind.

Today, I'm certified as a <a href="https://ncsf.org/">personal trainer</a>, <a href="https://www.stretchtowin.com/page/what-is-fst">fascia stretch therapist</a>, and an <a href="https://www.gymnasticsontario.ca/education/coach-ed/nccp-course-information/">adult gymnastics coach</a>. 

With a background in <a href="https://skhs.queensu.ca/students/undergrad/health">Health Studies</a> from Queen's University, training in the <a href="https://www.idiinventory.com/">Intercultural Development Inventory</a> and more than 9 years of experience as a project manager in the private and public sectors, my experience includes over 15 years of health and wellness education and practice. I find the intersection of movement and art fascinating, and have trained in health studies, dance, voice, theatre, and the fine arts.
