I specialize in helping adults improve their functional mobility. This is a mobile service, so I come to you. I travel within the Hamilton/Burlington area.

<p>To book any of the following <b>personal services</b> please send me an <a href="mailto:freethefoot.hamilton@gmail.com">email</a>.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Fascial Stretch Therapy</li>
    <li>Personal Training</li>
</ul>

For FST, I will need a space to set up a massage table. For personal training, I train body weight exercises mostly, but I could offer light resistance equipment, such as kettlebells, bands, elastics, stability ball etc. If you have your own equipment/home gym, we can work with that!
