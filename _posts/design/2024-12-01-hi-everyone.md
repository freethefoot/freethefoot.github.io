My name is Renata and I'm an <a href="https://ncsf.org/">NCSF certified personal trainer</a>, <a href="https://www.stretchtowin.com/page/what-is-fst">fascial stretch therapist</a>, and an <a href="https://www.gymnasticsontario.ca/education/coach-ed/nccp-course-information/">NCCP trained adult gymnastics coach</a>. I graduated with a minor in <a href="https://skhs.queensu.ca/students/undergrad/health">Health Studies</a> from Queen's University. And by night, I'm a project management professional (PMP). Working in an office for 10+ years was not my favourite, but my background certainly helps me relate to many clients. 

I've passionately built my skillset with today's movement challenges in mind, such as burnout, sedentary jobs and jobs where overwork and injuries are common (i.e. healthcare). 

In my own life, I've repeatedly experienced the following pattern: 

<blockquote><b>Degeneration:</b> As a hardcore student or employee I wouldn't move much for most of the day so I'd develop somekind of issue (i.e. burnout, IT band syndrome, bulging disc, worsening eyesight, irratability, headaches etc).</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Activation:</b> One day, I'd get so fed up that I'd go out and move to the extreme (i.e. climbing a pretty serious volcano (2017), training with ex-competitive gymnasts (2019), walking 50km in one day (2020), doing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XCFHHW_uv4">150km thru-hike (2024)</a> etc).</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Incapacitation:</b> Even though I thought I was well-prepared, I'd usually get mild to seriously injured.</blockquote>  

<blockquote><b>Regeneration:</b> So I'd go out and get help... aka hire a personal trainer, join group fitness class, visit a body specialist (i.e. chiropractor, physiotherapist, osteopath, massage therapist, fascial stretch therapist, kinesiologist etc)</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Education:</b> I would feel so grateful that I'd become obsessed with the thing. Sometimes, I'd go so far as to gain a certification in it. </blockquote>

Now I know that even if my body does not succeed in the challenge initially, I'll watch it heal and strengthen over time. And I've come to understand what's important for fitness and wellness success: waking up the nervous system, creating stability, and combining play into my routine. 

As a health and wellness professional, I'm knowledgeable, certified, and excited to help you or someone you love to achieve their wellness goals!
