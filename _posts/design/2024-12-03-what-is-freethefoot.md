In 2018, my personal trainer introduced me to minimalist footwear and fascia health. Training in <a href="https://www.vibram.com/ca">Vibrams</a> made my brain felt tingly because even my toes were working! Suddenly, regular running shoes seemed to make concentration, balance, and movement harder...

So I bought hot pink toe shoes and wore them everywhere, even the office. I even experimented walking completely barefoot around the city ("grounding"). 

Today, "FreeTheFoot" means more than just walking around in minimalist shoes. It means trading in sedentary lifestyles for ones filled with movement. Sometimes this means healing our bodies, improving our footwear, and changing our fitness patterns. 

Other times it means working in our communities to create better OPPORTUNITIES to move. So I participate in <a href="https://www.hamilton.ca/sites/default/files/2022-11/biking-cyclists-mobility-lab-cycling-network-terms-of-refrence.pdf">City of Hamilton's Cycling Network</a> to improve our network of bike paths and have produced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ux2XqidBVs">a short documentary on walking across Hamilton</a> using its somewhat hidden trail network. 

FreeTheFoot was born from interesting fitness and social questions: Is it our fault that we don't move when our jobs demand we sit? What if we don't clean, fresh air or shelter against traffic?

I love building connections with people are as puzzled by these questions and desire to answer them as I am.
