When it comes to emergencies, I'm not a wilderness camper! Just a thru-hiker concerned with keeping herself clean, safe, and comfortable on her journey. The emergency complex helps with immediate, non-health-related issues to allow me to keep hiking safely OR to keep me safe until I can exit the trail. And as always, for more complex emergencies I check my location often and bring an emergency battery pack in case I needed to call for help. 

With the emergency complex, I weighed each item to see if I could think of a better way to make it smaller/lighter and take it along. These were the questions I asked myself: 

<ul>
    <li>"What would I need if my [tent, map, stove, shoes] fail(s)?"</li>
    <li>"Can I get this in a smaller size (i.e. big vs tiny duct tape rolls)</li>
    <li>"How can I resize/lighten this but make sure it's still useful?"</li>
    <li>"How many things can I use this for? (i.e. duct tape for mending clothes AND tent)"</li>
</ul>

Here's what I packed:

<ul>
    <li>Mini roll of duct tape</li>
    <li>2 plastic grocery bags</li>
    <li>Waterproof matches (yes, in addition to the everyday lighter in my food complex)</li>
    <li>Small tissue pack</li>
    <li>Re-chargable battery pack</li>
    <li>Combination pocket knife</li>
    <li>Multi-purpose Foil Rescue Blanket</li> 
    <li>2m of rope</li> 
    <li>Whistle</li>
    <li>Compass</li>
    <li>ONE extra carabiner</li>
</ul> 

Of all these items, the duct tape seems to be the most handy. I've used it to reinforce my pack when it started to tear, as well as my Vibrams when I wore them out! The next most useful items are often the plastic bags, which are great to keep your feet dry (if you have a blister or a hole in your hiking boots) or provide extra storage in a pinch. I'd recommend getting the best quality waterproof matches possible. The rechargable battery pack and combination pocket knife are the heaviest items in emergency complex, but could prove very useful in an emergency, so I shave off weight in other places. And even though I've thankfully never used the foil blanket or whistle, I will always pack them for peace of mind.

My additional advice: make sure you practice how to use a compass. It is NOT the same as location services!
