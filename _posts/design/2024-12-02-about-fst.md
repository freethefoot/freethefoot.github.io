On a basic level, FST is assisted stretching actively performed by the therapist on their client, who is mostly passive but sometimes minorly active in the stretching. 

In 2017 and I was received FST for the first time after a personal training session. My calves were too tight, so my personal trainer sat on the ground while I leaned forward against a wall. They wrapped their hands right above my ankle, straightened their arms, and leaned back, and swayed right and left. This moved my leg skin and muscle back and forth against the bone. It was so simple, but the relief was so profound that I was hooked.

I completed a Fascial Stretch Therapy Level 1 course with <a href="https://www.stretchtowin.com/page/what-is-fst">Stretch To Win</a> and re-certified in 2020. When I got back from the week-long course, I practiced FST on everyone. Some were as crazy about it as I was. But even skeptics said they felt more relaxed and had a good sleep afterward. 

I love FST because this deepdive into fascia helps me understand some of the very basic principles of different health and wellness practices, so I'm confident I can direct you further help you might need.
